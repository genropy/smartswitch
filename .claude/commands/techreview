# Technical Code Review

Perform a comprehensive technical review of the project codebase and generate a detailed report.

## Review Criteria

Analyze the codebase according to these 8 criteria:

### 1. Code Organization
- Check project structure and file organization
- Verify logical separation of concerns
- Assess module/package boundaries

### 2. Function Length & Complexity
- Identify functions/methods that are too long (>50 lines)
- Detect deeply nested code (>4 levels of indentation)
- Flag complex conditional logic

### 3. Comments & Naming
- Verify comments are accurate and helpful
- Check variable/function names are meaningful
- Identify misleading or outdated comments

### 4. Excellent Code Examples 🌟
- Highlight particularly well-written code
- Identify exemplary patterns and practices
- Note code worth using as reference

### 5. Architecture Issues 🚨
- Identify inflexible or hard-to-maintain designs
- Detect tight coupling or circular dependencies
- Flag architectural anti-patterns

### 6. Usage of Our Tools
- Check if we're using our own tools (smartswitch, gtext, tryfly, etc.)
- Suggest where our tools could be applied
- Identify opportunities to "eat our own dog food"

### 7. Thread Safety & Async Issues ⚡
- Identify potential race conditions
- Check for proper async/await usage
- Flag missing thread synchronization

### 8. Suggested Improvements 💭
- Provide concrete refactoring suggestions
- Recommend performance optimizations
- Suggest better patterns or practices

## Report Generation

1. **Analyze** all Python files in `src/` directory
2. **Generate** markdown report with findings
3. **Save** to `tech_report/tech_report_NNN.md` (auto-increment number)
4. **Summarize** key findings and overall score

## Instructions for Claude

When user types `/techreview`:

1. **Scan codebase**: Read all Python files in `src/` (and `tests/` if relevant)
2. **Analyze against criteria**: Go through each of the 8 criteria systematically
3. **Be critical but constructive**: Point out issues but also highlight good practices
4. **Generate report**: Create numbered report in `tech_report/` directory
5. **Summarize**: Provide brief summary of most important findings

**Important**:
- Focus on **production code** (src/), not build/config files
- Be **specific**: Include file:line references for issues
- Be **balanced**: Highlight both problems and excellent code
- Be **actionable**: Suggest concrete improvements
- **Check our own tools usage**: This is a "genro" project, we should use genro tools!

## Scope

- **Default**: All files in `src/` directory
- **Include tests**: If explicitly asked
- **Exclude**: Build artifacts, dependencies, generated code
